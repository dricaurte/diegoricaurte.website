            <h2>Signature Website</h2>
            <h4> Brand / Digital / UI <h4> 
              <p> <b> Objective: </b> After graduating from Cornell, I decided to take some time to fine tune my digital design skills. I versed myself in multiple coding languages, with the goal being to construct my own website that showcased these new skills as well as my portfolio. The site was to give the viewer a feel not only for who I am as a designer, but also as a person. </p>
              <p> <b> Challenge: </b> The challenge in creating this website was in the importance of simplicity. The average viewer might only spend seconds on the site, so ease of navigation and clean design are a must. Furthermore, the design needs to house a variety of portfolio pieces, which calls for design choices that mesh with many different brands and styles. Last but most certainly not least, the site needed to be memorable and unique, as to prevent it from being glossed over by any potential employer. </p>
              <p> <b> Solution: </b> The website you are on right now, as well as all of its collateral, was designed and hand coded by yours truly. Its been designed to immerse the viewer into my world of design, and give a sense of my environment, personality, and design preference. The responsive interface prioritizes a user-friendly experience, and maintains a clean, simple aesthetic that is up to date with today's digital design standards. The portfolio pages are purposefully simple in order to not interfere with the themes of the different portfolio pieces. With my resume, skill set, and work samples never more than a click away, diegoricaurte.website is your one stop for everything you need to know about your next star employee. </p>
