            <p> After graduating from Cornell, I decided to take some time to fine tune my digital design skills. After versing myself in multiple coding languages, I decided to construct my own website to showcase these improved skills as well as my work. My goal was to give the viewer a feel not only for who I am as a designer, but also as a person. The website you are on right now, as well as all of its collateral, was designed and hand coded by yours truly. <p>
