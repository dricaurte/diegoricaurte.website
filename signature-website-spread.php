          <h3 class="portfoliotitle2"> Objective </h3>
          <p class="portfolioitemtext"> The primary objective in creating my own website portfolio was to give potential employers and recruiters an impression of what I am capable of as a digital and graphic designer. The positive aesthetic along with a fluid user experience should leave the user with a sense of my skill set as a digital and graphic designer, and ultimately lead to professional design opportunities. </p>

          <h3 class="portfoliotitle2"> Process </h3>
          <p class="portfolioitemtext"> Being my own client allowed for more freedom in the development process, but I still opted to start with low fidelity wire frames in order to be as efficient as possible with my work flow. The theme of my site was my own design environment, so I also took the time to capture a few photos and layouts that would capture the essence of my websites theme. I also created a user empathy map for the primary user: a design recruiter. A recruiter may only spend a few seconds to get an impression on the site, and with that in mind, ease of navigation and clean design were a priority. Furthermore, the design needed to house a variety of portfolio pieces, which called for design choices that meshed with many different brands and styles. Last but not least, the site should to be memorable and unique, as to prevent it from being glossed over by any potential employer. </p>

          <h3 class="portfoliotitle2"> Reflection </h3>
          <p class="portfolioitemtext"> Designing as my own client at first seemed like a frictionless and stress free process, but I quickly learned that it is in these kinds of assignments that you have to be doubly careful. You have to act as your own biggest critic in order to bring the best out of your design sense, and even then you should be humble, flexible, and steadfast in your journey to seek constructive criticism.</p>
