          <h3 class="portfoliotitle2"> Objective </h3>
          <p class="portfolioitemtext"> My objective in this assignment was to create a new layout for Caroline's blog. I aimed to create an interface that was more responsive and modern than the one she had in place at the time. Caroline's work and writing revolves around an urban culture, so I wanted to create a site that best reflected her personality as well as her work style. Most importantly, my goal was to design an interface that allowed for ease of navigation for the user, so that access to the blog posts was natural and seamless. </p>

        </div>
        <div class= "col-xs-8 centered">
          <h3 class="portfoliotitle2"> Process </h3>
          <p class="portfolioitemtext"> My process began by asking Caroline explicitly what she was looking for in a website, and what parts of her current website she found most appealing. After sending her a few website examples based on her feedback, I moved forward with low fidelity mock ups detailing a information hierarchy and design layout. I continued the initial process by creating a user persona of what I perceived to be a likely reader of her blog. Caroline wanted a distinctive look to her site, and noted that she was a fan of Andy Warhol's pop art, and would like that to be incorporated. The interface I created would have to mesh with such a unique visual style. </p>

        </div>
        <div class= "col-xs-8 centered">
          <h3 class="portfoliotitle2"> Solution </h3>
          <p class="portfolioitemtext"> To create an ease of navigation, I created a single page layout revolving around the blog posts. The responsive site would be compatible with any device, accessible to at-home and on-the-go readers. Each article would be represented with a title, image, and the beginnings of each post in order to draw in the reader, encouraging them to read on. The style of the page is also quite minimalistic, focusing on gray scale tones in order to compliment the pop art color highlights in the logo. </p>

          <h3 class="portfoliotitle2"> Reflection </h3>
          <p class="portfolioitemtext"> Designing for Caroline was an absolute pleasure, but was not without its challenges and learning experiences. The changes I proposed to Caroline were at times a bit drastic, which led to some pullback on her side. In the end, however, I found that research and attention to user needs helped ease that process when well presented to the client.</p>
