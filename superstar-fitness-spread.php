            <h2>Tapout: Superstar Fitness</h2>
            <h4> Brand / Digital / UI <h4> 
            <p> <b> Objective: </b> Every WWE Superstar plays a myriad of roles, from in-ring warrior, to actor, to athlete, and of course, role model. WWE Superstar Fitness is a concept expansion of the Tapout brand, with the objective of allowing the superstars of the WWE to interact with their fans on the fitness landscape. The platforms purpose is to encourage WWE fans to follow their idols on a road to better health. </p>

            <p> <b> Challenge: </b> To expand upon any brand, one has to be conscious of the design standards already in place. While the expansion should of course be innovative and bring new ideas to the table, it also has to integrate seamlessly into the current interface structure. </p>

            <p> <b> Solution: </b> My concept expansion builds upon the current website structure, and expands upon the current brand style. Each month the user is presented with four different superstars. Each superstar has a personalized fitness page, where the user can follow their daily routines, and a weekly vlog for a more dynamic look. Through the desktop and mobile interface, Superstar Fitness allows any fan to see exactly how their favorite superstar is maintaining their workout regimen, and encourages them to follow along in their footsteps, day by day.</p>
