            <p> <b> Objective: </b> AGV Sports group is a company that makes gear for bike riders. My primary project was designing the new line of "hang tags" that will be attached to new products in 2014. </p>

            <p> <b> Challenge: </b>The primary challenge was designing a tag that could accompany a myriad of different products - helmets, gloves, suits, boots, jeans - while still maintaining a consistent brand image. All in all, this tag design would accompany a total of 75 different riding products. </p>

            <p> <b> Solution: </b> My solution to this design challenge was a tag that utilized an icons and brief descriptions, customized to each individual product. The tags would utilize a bold orange hue to catch the eye of the customer as well as define a unique and recognizable brand. Over 20 different icons and descriptions were used to customize this new design format according to each product's specifications.  </p>
