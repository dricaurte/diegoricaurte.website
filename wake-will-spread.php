          <h3 class="portfoliotitle2"> Objective </h3>
          <p class="portfolioitemtext"> The goal of Wake Will was to give rise to a groundswell of support from a devoted community of Wake Foresters, and to lay the foundation for the pursuit of something even greater. With this in mind, it was my objective to create interactive stations that would engage and captivate guests, sending a message to the target audience of the Wake Forest Alumni population.</p>

        <div class= "col-xs-8 centered">
          <h3 class="portfoliotitle2"> Process </h3>
          <p class="portfolioitemtext"> My design process began with wire frame sketches of the interactive stations. This allowed me to get a better sense of a layout for these interactive pieces, and how to incorporate the Wake Forest branding into my design. This incorporation was crucial in engaging the target audience of the Wake Forest Alumni.</p>

        </div>
        <div class= "col-xs-8 centered">
          <h3 class="portfoliotitle2"> Solution </h3>
          <p class="portfolioitemtext"> The interactive stations focused on user interactivity. The Wake Will Book invites Alumni to share Wake Forest's impact on their lives. The rotating cube's displays achievements of current Wake Undergraduates, allowing alumni to explore different students with each side of the cube. By encouraging Alumni to learn more about the current Wake Forest population, as well as reminisce their own history with the institution, the two stations incite action in the Alumni and fostered a greater pride in their alma mater.</p>

          <h3 class="portfoliotitle2"> Reflection </h3>
          <p class="portfolioitemtext"> Designing to such a well established brand was certainly intimidating, given that this was one of my very first major design assignments. The experience ended up being a very positive one, and an excellent introduction to the core tenants in a well rounded and thoughtful design process.</p>
