            <h2>The Key Elements</h2>
            <h4> Brand / Digital / UI </h4> 
            <p> <b> Objective: </b> During my time at Cornell University, I was a member of The Key Elements co-ed a cappella group, and the group's Head of Creative Design. As such, my primary objective was to revamp The Key Elements branding image, which at the time was both outdated and focused on the rock music genre, effectively alienating a good portion of the Cornell population.
            <p/>
            <p> <b> Challenge: </b> Creating an image with an appeal wide enough for the entire Cornell population is no small task. The new brand needed to be attractive to all viewers, regardless of music preference or gender, in order to maximize audition and concert attendance. Furthermore, the new image would also need the approval to the members currently in the group. Lastly, this rebrand had to set the Key Elements apart from any of the other 20+ singing groups on campus</p>
            <p><b> Solution: </b> The newly designed logo maintains the core 'bolt' motif of the original imaging, and adds a musical component in order to stay true to the nature of the group. The hand coded, user and mobile friendly website utilizes a simple scroll-through structure, and navigates the user through the groups members, music, merchandise. The overall tone of the website is neutral and people-focused, allowing the personality of the group to shine through, and creates a genuine experience of The Key Elements A Cappella. <p/>
