          <h3 class="portfoliotitle2"> Objective </h3>
          <p class="portfolioitemtext"> My primary objective during my internship at GTech Designs was to spearhead a visual re-branding, creating a uniform image across web and print. This re-branding would facilitate the launch of a marketing portfolio targeted toward potential clients looking to re-brand their own materials. The resulting collateral would include new print materials as well as a redesigned landing page. </p>

        </div>
        <div class= "col-xs-8 centered">
          <h3 class="portfoliotitle2"> Process </h3>
          <p class="portfolioitemtext"> The design process began with low fidelity wire frames of the sections that would be make up the digital and print materials. I also developed a user persona that illustrated the primary clientele of Gtech, and in turn the audience of the new collateral. The brand identity needed to seamlessly transition between print and web materials, creating a uniform experience for the user regardless of the entry point. With that in mind, I organized the information in a grid style that would translate well to print as well as digital format. </p>

        </div>
        <div class= "col-xs-8 centered">
          <h3 class="portfoliotitle2"> Solution </h3>
          <p class="portfolioitemtext"> The resulting print and web design allows for and clear and clean user journey throughout the new collateral. My re-branding image expanded on the purple logo of GTech Designs, using the same hue to accent the websites focal points. The print pamphlet guides the user through an introduction to Gtech's brand and mission, followed by their design approach as how potential clients can get in contact. The website follows a similar hierarchy, and expands on the pamphlet materials by providing examples of GTech's past successful projects. Together, the site and print materials serve as an example for what GTech can accomplish for its clients; a clean, modern, and story driven design style that is clean and professions, but also with a personal touch that can be trusted. </p>

          <h3 class="portfoliotitle2"> Reflection </h3>
          <p class="portfolioitemtext"> This project allowed me to first explore digital design, and develop my sense of creating a uniform branding image. Not only was I forced to design to a completely new medium for one of the first times, but I also had to figure out how to create a uniform visual identity utilizing both digital and print mediums simultaneously.</p>
