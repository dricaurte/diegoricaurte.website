            <h2>DR Design</h2>
            <h4> Brand / Digital / UI </h4> 
            <br>
            <p> <b> Objective: </b> DR Design is the first iteration of my design brand. The objective of this project was to create a simple, modern, and user friendly landing page that focuses the user on the design portfolio. </p> 

            <p> <b> Challenge: </b> As with any portfolio, the biggest challenge to overcome is standing out amongst a large pool of talented applicants. This site would have to be highly personal, unique, eye catching, and of course, memorable. </p>
            
            <p> <b> Solution: </b> The resulting hand-coded website utilizes a grid layout with a simple page structure consisting of a landing page that links to each individual portfolio piece, as well as a resume. The color palette consists of different shades of digital blue, with a brighter shade highlighting user focus. Personalized icons are used throughout the site in order to create a unique style that is simple enough not to detract from the variety of styles presented on the portfolio pages.</p>
