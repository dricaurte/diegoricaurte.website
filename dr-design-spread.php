            <h2>DR Design</h2>
            <h4> Brand / Icons / Illustration / Website <h4> 
            <p> DR Design is the first iteration of my design brand. It uses a flat, modern, minimalistic style with a focus on outlines. When deciding
            on the theme of my website and portfolio, I wanted something up to date and in tune with the current online 
            design trends, as well as something personal and eye catching. As a result, I made my illustrations
            in a bold digital blue, and personalized the brand with an initaled logo as well as a self portrait of sorts.
            Alternate art included may of what I consider to be my "essentials" in my graphic and web design work. The website itself is hand coded by 
            yours truly.
